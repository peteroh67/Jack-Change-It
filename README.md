***GAME RULES***
Players are each dealt 7 starting cards. They take turns, starting clockwise, playing 1 card each. The winner is the first to get rid of all cards.
A starting card is chosen from the deck. The first player must play a card that matches the suit or face of this starting card.
Subsequent players must play a card that matches the suit or face of the new top card, and so on.
If a player does not have a valid card to play, then they must pick up a card from the deck. 
Players can also choose to pick up a card instead of playing a valid card.

***Trick cards***
2 -- The next player must pick up 2 cards instead of playing a card |
8 -- The next player misses a turn |
Q -- Changes the direction of play |
J -- Any Jack can be played at any time. The player chooses to change the playable suit to one of their choice. The next player must then play a card of this suit |
A of H -- The next player must pick up 5 cards instead of playing a card, unless they hold the Five of Hearts |
5 of H -- Defends against the Ace of Hearts |

Once a player runs out of cards. The other players cards are tallied to get total player points and provide a ranking. 
The lower the ranking the better and the player who ran out of cards gets 0 points.
All trick cards get a total of 20 points. All other cards get their face value.
